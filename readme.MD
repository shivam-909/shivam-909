hi! 

i'm shivam, 18, based in london. i'm currently starting my bachelor's in computer science whilst managing my fintech startup (seed stage funding secured!!).

i mainly work with golang 💗, and spend most of my time building backend software and working on ML models. some other technologies i work with daily are docker,
kubernetes, kafka, and cockroachDB.

atm, i'm studying to get my kubernetes cloud administrator certification and my aws cloud practitioner certification, as well as building out 
technical prototypes for METIS (startup i mentioned, [check it out!](https://metis.sfninety.com)).

if you're interested in any of the work i do, feel free to reach out!!
